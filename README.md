# Pairs Game
This is a source code for an online game available [here.](https://krzzalew.github.io/pairs/)\
\
Pairs is a popular memory game. This version features a single-player and two-players mode. At each turn a player flips two chosen cards from the board.
If it's a match the cards are removed and the player scores one point and continues. Otherwise the turn ends and cards are flipped back.
The game continues until all the pairs from board are matched. Player with the greater sum of point wins.\
\
This game enables players to choose from 4 board sizes and 4 different card themes. When starting a new game a random set of picture pairs is generated.
There is also an additional option to toggle guessed cards' visibility. The accuracy of each player is calculated based on the ratio of correct moves
to all the player's moves (a move is considered correct if a card is flipped for the first time or a pair is matched).\
\
The game was designed to adjust well to various screen sizes.
